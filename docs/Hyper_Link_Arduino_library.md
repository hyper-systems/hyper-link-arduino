# Hyper Link Arduino library

Hyper Link is a hardware component that adds connectivity and easy data IO to
your project. Read more on the [Hyper Link](#) page.

The Hyper Link Arduino library provides utilities specific to your device
schema so that you can easily publish sensor or diagnostic values and receiving
commands from other devices.

A typical workflow for working with the Hyper Link Arduino library is:

1. **DEFINE YOUR DEVICE SCHEMA**: Define a device schema as a collection of read and write
   attributes that represent the capabilities of your device.
2. **DOWNLOAD THE ARDUINO LIBRARY**: Download the Arduino library auto-generated
   specifically for device schema.
3. **SETUP YOUR BOARD**: Make sure you have Hyper-compatible components and
   configure your Arduino IDE.
4. **INTEGRATE THE ARDUINO LIBRARY**: Follow the instructions to include the
   library and start working with the software resprestation of your device to
   record sensor values and bind incoming command handlers.
5. **TEST YOUR SETUP**: Connect everything together and start testing data publishing and command execution.
