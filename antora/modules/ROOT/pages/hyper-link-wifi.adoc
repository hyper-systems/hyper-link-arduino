NOTE: If the network setup window does not open
automatically, you can go to `http://hyper-link.local` in your browser.

After completing the configuration, the Hyper Link WiFi device will restart and
connect to your network.

The LED on the board will stop blinking and stays on, indicating that the device is now connected
to WiFi.

== Open the device monitoring UI
You can connect to the same network as the one you connected the Hyper Link WiFi in the previous step, and go to `http://hyper-link.local`
in your browser.

This page lists all of the devices connected to the Hyper Link WiFi device,
including the Hyper Like device itself (which is always the first device
in the list).

Every device entry is composed of the following details:

* *Device class identifier* - an identifier of the device schema which represents
a group of devices sharing the same attributes.
* **Unique device identifier** - a 6-byte long device identifier which _must_ be
globally unique.
// TODO: Add a link to the "Obtaining unique device identifiers" page.
* *Last message time* - the time when the last message was received from the device.
* *Attribute values* - a list of all read attributes recorded by the device. Each
attribute is annotated with an attribute slot number.

The data encoding used for messages and attributes is optimized to be as compact as
possible, which means that no metadata is transmitted about the attributes, their
names and characteristics. This is why the attributes are annotated with their slot
numbers and not actual human-readable names. You can consult the device class
definition to map the slot numbers to the respective attribute names.
