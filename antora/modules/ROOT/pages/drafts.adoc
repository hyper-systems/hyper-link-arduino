= Quickstart

Hyper Link is a hardware component that adds connectivity and easy data
IO to your project. Read more on the link:#[Hyper Link] page.

The Hyper Link Arduino library provides utilities specific to your
device schema so that you can easily publish sensor or diagnostic values
and receiving commands from other devices.

A typical workflow for working with the Hyper Link Arduino library is:

[arabic]
. link:#define-your-device-schema[*Define your device schema*]: define a
device schema as a collection of read and write attributes that
represent the capabilities of your device.
. link:#download-the-arduino-library[*Download the arduino library*]:
download the Arduino library auto-generated specifically for device
schema.
. link:#setup-your-board[*Setup your board*]: make sure you have
Hyper-compatible components and configure your Arduino IDE.
. link:#integrate-the-arduino-library[*Integrate the arduino library*]:
follow the instructions to include the library and start working with
the software resprestation of your device to record sensor values and
bind incoming command handlers.
. link:#test-your-setup[*Test your setup*]: connect everything together
and start testing data publishing and command execution.

Below is a detailed description of every step.


== Define your device schema

Head to https://hyper.systems and log-in into your dashboard. In the
sidebar menu select btn:[Device types] and click the btn:[Create new device
type] button in the toolbar. A form for defining a new device type will
appear where you can provide a detailed description about your device
type, including the supported read/write attributes and their data
types.

Once you are happy with the description of your device type press the
btn:[Save] button. Congratulations you have completed the definition of
your device type!


== Download the arduino library

After completing the previous step you will be able to open your device
type page. This page includes all of the details about the read and
write attributes of your device type.

You can click the btn:[Download Arduino library] button in the toolbar to
get a ZIP archieve containing an example Arduino project that
demonstrates how to work with your device type.

In addition to downloading the library you can also consult the
libraryâ€™s API documentation for your device type.
