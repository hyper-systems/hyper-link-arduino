= Hyper Link Thread

The Hyper Link Thread device is a custom board provided by Hyper for connectivity with the Thread mesh network protocol.

Devices that implement the Hyper Link protocol and have an I2C connector can be connected to the Hyper Link Thread board to start publishing data to a cloud environment using the Thread mesh network.
