= Quickstart

Hyper Link is a hardware component that adds connectivity and easy data
IO to your project. Read more on the link:#[Hyper Link] page.

The Hyper Link Arduino library provides utilities specific to your
device schema so that you can easily publish sensor or diagnostic values
and receiving commands from other devices.

A typical workflow for working with the Hyper Link Arduino library is:

[arabic]
. link:#define-your-device-schema[*Define your device schema*]: define a
device schema as a collection of read and write attributes that
represent the capabilities of your device.
. link:#download-the-arduino-library[*Download the arduino library*]:
download the Arduino library auto-generated specifically for device
schema.
. link:#setup-your-board[*Setup your board*]: make sure you have
Hyper-compatible components and configure your Arduino IDE.
. link:#integrate-the-arduino-library[*Integrate the arduino library*]:
follow the instructions to include the library and start working with
the software resprestation of your device to record sensor values and
bind incoming command handlers.
. link:#test-your-setup[*Test your setup*]: connect everything together
and start testing data publishing and command execution.

Below is a detailed description of every step.

== Define your device schema

Head to https://hyper.systems and log-in into your dashboard. In the
sidebar menu select btn:[Device types] and click the btn:[Create new device
type] button in the toolbar. A form for defining a new device type will
appear where you can provide a detailed description about your device
type, including the supported read/write attributes and their data
types.

Once you are happy with the description of your device type press the
btn:[Save] button. Congratulations you have completed the definition of
your device type!

== Download the arduino library

After completing the previous step you will be able to open your device
type page. This page includes all of the details about the read and
write attributes of your device type.

You can click the btn:[Download Arduino library] button in the toolbar to
get a ZIP archieve containing an example Arduino project that
demonstrates how to work with your device type.

In addition to downloading the library you can also consult the
libraryâ€™s API documentation for your device type.

== Setup your board

Follow the official instructions for configuring the Arduino IDE for
your board.

== Integrate the arduino library

The Arduino library code for your device type will include an example
`main` file that demonstrates how to initialise and start using your
device type.

You start making changes to the code to add any modifications necessary
for your project.

The following sections must be present in your code to get a working
integration:

=== 1. Include the library code

[source,cpp]
----
// Include the generated support code for working with your device over
// I2C-slave interface. Replacce "XXX" with your unique device type identifier.
#include "HyperDeviceXXXI2CSlave.V1.h"
----

=== 2. Define the global device variable

[source,cpp]
----
// Define a variable for your Hyper device in the global scope to make it easy
// for your to access the device anywhere in your code.
HyperDeviceXXXI2CSlave hyperDevice;
----

=== 3. Setup the device identifier and bind write attributes

[source,cpp]
----
void setup() {
  // All devices must have a unique identifer composed of 6 hex characters. 
  // If possible use your boards MAC address or find an equivalent unique identifer.
  const uint8_t deviceId[6] = {0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01};
  hyperDevice.begin(deviceId);

  // Bind write attributes.
  // Write attributes can be used to push data to your device from the server.
  // This section can be used to assign custom function handlers for every
  // write attribute. The function callback can perform any changes to the
  // device necessary to react to the attribute change.
  hyperDevice.bindMyAttribute1(onMyAttribute1Update);
}
----

=== 4. Record read attribute changes

[source,cpp]
----
void loop() {
  int adcVal = analogRead(A0);

  // Record the values for your read attributes.
  hyperDevice.setMyAttribute1(adcVal); <.>

  delay(1000);
}
----
<.> The included header has setter functions for all the attributes of your device.

Having completed these code changes your project is ready to start
publishing read attribute values and processing write attribute updates
from the server.

You can always refer to the ZIP archieve for a complete example of the
integration.

== Test your setup

Once you have completed the software integration and uploaded the code
to your board, you can start testing the setup by connecting your board
to the Hyper Link device.

To connect the Hyper Link device you need to use a I2C-compatible port.
Our boards come with a I2C 3.3V QWIIC connector.

Hyper provides multiple Link devices for both development and production
scenarios.

During production you can use a Hypr Link device that supports a network
protocol most suitable for your deployment such as Thread, Bluetooth,
LoRa or WiFi.

For development we recommend using our Hyper Link WiFi device that makes
is easy to visualise the data coming in and out of your board. You can
work with it offline or online.

=== Monitor your Arduino board with the Hyper Link WiFi device

During development it is convenient to be able to inspect the
communication channel between your Arduino board and the Hyper Link WiFi
device.

Refer to the xref:hyper-link-wifi.adoc[] page for more details on how to
set up the Hyper Wifi Link device.

Having these steps, you can now connect your board via I2C and start
monitoring your Arduino board with the Hyper Link WiFi device.
