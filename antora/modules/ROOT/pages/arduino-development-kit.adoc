= Arduino development kit

This documents presents an overview of the Arduino development kit provided
by Hyper. The development kit includes an Arduino development board with an
example source code for sensor integration and a
xref:hyper-link-wifi.adoc[] device that can be connected to the Arduino
development board to publish the data to the cloud deployment and allow local
monitoring during development.

== Components

The development kit includes the following components and parts:

* *Arduino board* - serves as an example external device programmed by users;
* *Hyper Link WiFi device* - a device that provides WiFi connectivity and can be used during development to monitor the values recorded by the Arduino board;
* *Hyper Link Thread device* - a device that provides https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(network_protocol)[Thread] connectivity and can be used in a production environment to connect the Arduino board to a Thread mesh network.
* *Bidirectional I2C isolator* - an I2C isolator with two STEMMA QT/Qwiic connectors that should be used to connect the Hyper Link devices to the Arduino board.

NOTE: The Hyper Link Thread device requires a Thread-compatible gateway device that creates the mesh network and forwards the data to Hyper's cloud environment. The development kit does not include the gateway.

=== Arduino board and I2C isolator

The Arduino board included in the kit is meant to be a reference example of an external device to be integrated with the Hyper platform. The Arduino board is pre-configured as an external Hyper device with a number of sensor attributes.

The source code of the the Arduino project is available at https://github.com/hyper-systems/hyper-link-arduino.

You can use this device to test the integration, program it in a way that suits your use case to collect any sensor measurements or even trigger execution of commands.

=== Hyper Link WiFi device

Use this device to connect the Arduino board provided in the kit to establish a WiFi connection and start collecting sensor readings. The collected data can be viewed locally in a web UI provided by the Hyper Link WiFi device itself and, in addition to that, will be published to a cloud deployment associated with your account.

For more information see the xref:hyper-link-wifi.adoc[] device page.


=== Hyper Link Thread device

Use this device to connect the Arduino board provided in the kit to establish a Thread connection with a Thread gateway device (such as Hyper Edge). Similar to the Hyper Link WiFi board, this device provides an I2C STEMMA QT/Qwiic connector.

Both Hyper Link Thread and Hyper Link WiFi devices implement the same data collection protocol allowing for seamless transition from WiFi to Thread connectivity.

NOTE: The Hyper Link Thread device was originally called "Hyper Axon". Some development kits might included a board with the "Hyper Axon Board" label.

For more information see the xref:hyper-link-thread.adoc[] device page.
