= Hyper Link Arduino

This documentation will help you integrate your first Arduino-compatible device with Hyper's data platform.

Hyper offers a selection of "Link" devices that allow your Arduino-compatible board to get automatic connectivity for a variety of IoT networks such as Thread, ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, _etc_. In addition to that a "Link WiFi" device can be used during development to simplify the integration process.

By integrating your devices with Hyper, your can start collecting sensor data faster while getting access to detailed metrics, automation and many other features.
